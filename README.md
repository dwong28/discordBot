# DwongerBot

DwongerBot is a discord Bot application that I made for personal use, as well as use on my League of Legends Club's Discord Server. 

# What I used
To communicate with various APIs, I utilized wrappers that were recommended to me by peers, as well as searching on google to find which wrapper would best suit my needs.
